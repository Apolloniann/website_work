            <p>Our goal is to spread the message of the Prophet Muhammad Rasulullah (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) to all mankind (Muslims and non-Muslims) throughout this world free of cost. By collecting all books of Hadith in one place, we are trying to make the Hadith search easy. This one source of Hadith Hub project is to produce a standard Hadith text and serve as a reliable source on the web.</p>

            <p>Hadith Hub is started by a group of Muslims living in different parts of the world.  We hope and pray to Allah that this web portal will serve as a source of guidance and light for all human beings throughout the face of this earth, regardless of race, color, age, nationality, and religion (Aameen).</p>
